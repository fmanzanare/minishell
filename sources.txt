getcwd(char *buf, size_t size)
    The getcwd() function copies the absolute pathname of the current working
    directory into the memory referenced by buf and returns a pointer to buf.
    The size argument is the size, in bytes, of the array referenced by buf.

    If buf is NULL, space is allocated as necessary to store the pathname and
    size is ignored.  This space may later be free(3)'d.

chdir()
    The chdir() function shall cause the directory named by the pathname pointed to by the
    path argument to become the current working directory; that is, the starting point for
    path searches for pathnames not beginning with '/'.

stat()
    The stat() function shall obtain information about the named file and write it to the 
    area pointed to by the buf argument. The path argument points to a pathname naming a 
    file. Read, write, or execute permission of the named file is not required. An 
    implementation that provides additional or alternate file access control mechanisms 
    may, under implementation-defined conditions, cause stat() to fail. In particular, 
    the system may deny the existence of the file specified by path.

    If the named file is a symbolic link, the stat() function shall continue pathname 
    resolution using the contents of the symbolic link, and shall return information 
    pertaining to the resulting file if the file exists.

    The buf argument is a pointer to a stat structure, as defined in the <sys/stat.h> 
    header, into which information is placed concerning the file.

    The stat() function shall update any time-related fields (as described in XBD File Times 
    Update), before writing into the stat structure.

    [SHM] [Option Start] If the named file is a shared memory object, the implementation shall 
    update in the stat structure pointed to by the buf argument the st_uid, st_gid, st_size,
    and st_mode fields, and only the S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH 
    file permission bits need be valid. The implementation may update other fields and flags. 
    [Option End]

    [TYM] [Option Start] If the named file is a typed memory object, the implementation shall 
    update in the stat structure pointed to by the buf argument the st_uid, st_gid, st_size, 
    and st_mode fields, and only the S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH 
    file permission bits need be valid. The implementation may update other fields and flags. 
    [Option End]

    For all other file types defined in this volume of POSIX.1-2017, the structure members 
    st_mode, st_ino, st_dev, st_uid, st_gid, st_atim, st_ctim, and st_mtim shall have meaningful 
    values and the value of the member st_nlink shall be set to the number of links to the file.

lstat()
    The lstat() function shall be equivalent to stat(), except when path refers to a symbolic 
    link. In that case lstat() shall return information about the link, while stat() shall return 
    information about the file the link references.

    For symbolic links, the st_mode member shall contain meaningful information when used with the 
    file type macros. The file mode bits in st_mode are unspecified. The structure members st_ino, 
    st_dev, st_uid, st_gid, st_atim, st_ctim, and st_mtim shall have meaningful values and the value 
    of the st_nlink member shall be set to the number of (hard) links to the symbolic link. The value 
    of the st_size member shall be set to the length of the pathname contained in the symbolic link not 
    including any terminating null byte.+

fstat()
    The fstat() function shall obtain information about an open file associated with the 
    file descriptor fildes, and shall write it to the area pointed to by buf.

unlink(const char *path)
    The unlink() function shall remove a link to a file. If path names a symbolic link, unlink() 
    shall remove the symbolic link named by path and shall not affect any file or directory named 
    by the contents of the symbolic link. Otherwise, unlink() shall remove the link named by the 
    pathname pointed to by path and shall decrement the link count of the file referenced by the link.

tcgetattr(int fildes, struct termios *termios_p)
    The tcgetattr() function shall get the parameters associated with the terminal referred to by fildes
    and store them in the termios structure referenced by termios_p. The fildes argument is an open 
    file descriptor associated with a terminal.

getenv(const char *name)
    The getenv() function shall search the environment of the calling process (see XBD Environment 
    Variables) for the environment variable name if it exists and return a pointer to the value of the 
    environment variable. If the specified environment variable cannot be found, a null pointer shall 
    be returned. The application shall ensure that it does not modify the string pointed to by the 
    getenv() function.

ioctl(int fildes, int request, ... /* arg */)
    The ioctl() function shall perform a variety of control functions on STREAMS devices. For 
    non-STREAMS devices, the functions performed by this call are unspecified. The request argument 
    and an optional third argument (with varying type) shall be passed to and interpreted by the 
    appropriate part of the STREAM associated with fildes.

*ttyname(int fildes)
    The ttyname() function shall return a pointer to a string containing a null-terminated pathname 
    of the terminal associated with file descriptor fildes. The application shall not modify the 
    string returned. The returned pointer might be invalidated or the string content might be 
    overwritten by a subsequent call to ttyname(). The returned pointer and the string content might 
    also be invalidated if the calling thread is terminated.

isatty(int fildes)
    The isatty() function shall test whether fildes, an open file descriptor, is associated with a 
    terminal device.

closedir(DIR *dirp)
    The closedir() function shall close the directory stream referred to by the argument dirp. Upon 
    return, the value of dirp may no longer point to an accessible object of the type DIR. If a file 
    descriptor is used to implement type DIR, that file descriptor shall be closed.
